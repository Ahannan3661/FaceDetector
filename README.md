# FaceDetector
A face detecting application that uses the images in "images" folder to match with the camera feed and identifies whether a person who's image is in the images folder is in front of the camera.
Once you have added a new image to the images folder first compile and run the Encoding Generator file to register the encoding of the new picture into the system.
Then you can run the main file and the system will now also consider the new image when it detects faces.
